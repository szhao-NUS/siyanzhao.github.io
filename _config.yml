description: My research is centered around the field of environmental microbiology, with a specialized focus on anaerobic/anoxic microbial processes. By integrating advanced cultivation and isolation methods, employing biochemical and genetic procedures, applying the state-of-the art analytical instrumentation, and exploiting high-throughput genomics and proteomics approaches, the aim is to advance the understanding of novel microorganisms and corresponding bioprocesses, so as to harness them to address environmental challenges.
